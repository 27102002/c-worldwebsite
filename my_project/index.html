                        It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory
                        and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions...

                        at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph),
                        located in the U.S.A. Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of
                        the c language. It was developed to overcome the problems of
                        previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc...

                    <p>C is a procedural programming language.
                        It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972.
                        It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write
                        an operating system. The main features of the C language
                        include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords,
                        and a clean style, these ...

                    <p>Being a middle-level language, C reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level
                        languages. It can be used for writing operating systems as well as doing application
