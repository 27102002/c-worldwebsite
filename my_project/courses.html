                        <p>A C program is made up of different tokens combined together. These tokens include:

                            Keywords
                            Identifiers
                            Constants
                            String Literal
                            Symbols.Keywords are reserved words that can not be used elsewhere in the program.</p>

                            For example, the symbol plus (+) is used to perform addition so it is an operator.
                           
                           We will discuss all sorts of operator here. Let’s start with the simpler one’s i.e. Arithmetic.</p>

This kind of situation is dealt in C language using a decision control instruction. </p>

                        <p>A do-while loop executes the statements inside the body of the do-while loop before checking the condition. So if a condition is false in the first place, then they do while would run once. A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.</p>

                            Functions are also called as procedure or subroutines.
